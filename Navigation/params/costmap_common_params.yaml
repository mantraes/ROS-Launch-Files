# Sensors
obstacle_range: 5.5 # The maximum range in meters at which to insert obstacles into the costmap using sensor data.
raytrace_range: 6.0 # The maximum range in meters at which to raytrace out obstacles from the map using sensor data.
inf_is_valid: false  # Allows for Inf values in "LaserScan" observation messages. The Inf values are converted to the laser maximun range.

footprint_padding: 0.10 # 10cm buffer for safety. maybe change for more precision
inflation_radius: 1.08
transform_tolerance: 1 # Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds.
