# Sensors
obstacle_range: 10 # The maximum range in meters at which to insert obstacles into the costmap using sensor data.
raytrace_range: 10 # The maximum range in meters at which to raytrace out obstacles from the map using sensor data.
inf_is_valid: true  # Allows for Inf values in "LaserScan" observation messages. The Inf values are converted to the laser maximun range.

# Robot Specific
footprint: [[ 0.765, 0.765], [ -0.765, 0.765], [ -0.765, -0.765], [ 0.765, -0.765]] # corrected to include tires in the footprint
footprint_padding: 0.10 # 10cm buffer for safety. maybe change for more precision
inflation_radius: 0.55
transform_tolerance: 1 # Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds.
controller_patience: 2.0 # How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.

# base global planner
NavfnROS:
   allow_unknown: true # Specifies whether or not to allow navfn to create plans that traverse unknown space.
